    This installation investigates the concept of stasis as a state of equilibrium or a state or condition
    in which things do not change, move, or progress. As the temperature goes below zero the molecules of
    water will create hydrogen bonds, forming a solid structure known as ice. This piece explores
    this condition by way of a generative piece made using the programming language SuperCollider
</p>
    The sound is created by a system consisting of two synthesizers,
    each following a separate routine. This results in a piece which never truly progresses,
    as there is no beginning or ending, and which in fact could be played indefinitely. The listener is asked
    to accept a static condition, and in doing so is able to become aware of the nuances of the sound.
    At the same time this allows room for stillness and perhaps even reflection.
    </p>

        The accompanying visualisation uses stills taken from video recordings made by the artist.
        This highlights the inherently static nature of film as a sequence of still images.
        The images are chosen at random and in real time which ties in with the generative nature
        of the sound installation.
